# Technolgies Used
 - Mongoose
 - Express
 - React
 - Node.js

 # Approach Taken
 
 Wireframe created.
 Pair programming for back-end and front-end and separate repositories and branches.
 Back-end must contain at least two models.
 Front-end uses React that leverages back-end API and CRUD. Uses axios.
 Deployed with Surge.

 # User Stories
 Forms

User signup: New user should be able to access the signup view and create a profile
User login: Logged out user should be able to access the login view and login via the login form
Media add: Logged in user should be able to add media to their profile
