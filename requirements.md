**Back-End Requirements**

[X] This app must contain a Node, Express, and Mongoose backend API with at least 2 models. (No associations are required. User authentication is strongly discouraged since it is often a major stumbling block.)  
[X] Must have Create, Read, Update, and Destroy functionality.  

**Front-End Requirements**

[X] This app must use a React front end that leverages the backend API in the above requirement.   
[X] Must use React Router to handle multiple views.  
[X] Must communicate with the back-end API RESTfully to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy resources, using fetch or axios.
